### Personal Contributions and Learning
- **Design Decisions**: All visual design choices and color schemes were my own decisions
- **Content Creation**: All written content, including this README, reflects my personal voice and goals
- **Problem Solving**: When AI suggestions didn't work as expected, I debugged and refined the code independently
- **Code Understanding**: I can explain every line of code in this project and made modifications to improve AI-generated suggestions

### Ethical Considerations
I used AI tools responsibly by:
- Properly attributing all AI assistance in this documentation
- Understanding and modifying all AI-generated code rather than copying blindly
- Using AI as a learning aid to understand web development concepts better
- Ensuring that my learning objectives were met through hands-on coding practice
